# Absurd

Absurd is a Postgres-native durable workflow system.  It moves the complexity of
durable execution into the database layer via stored procedures, keeping SDKs
lightweight and language-agnostic.  The core principle is to handle tasks that
may run for minutes, days, or years without losing state.

All you need is a Postgres database and the single
[`absurd.sql`](https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd/blob/main/sql/absurd.sql)
schema file.  No extra services, no message brokers, no coordination layer.
SDKs stay [simple too](https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd/blob/main/sdks/typescript/src/index.ts).

*… because it's absurd how much you can over-design such a simple thing.*

## How It Works

A **task** dispatches onto a **queue** from where a **worker** picks it up.
Tasks are subdivided into **steps** that act as checkpoints.  Once a step
completes successfully its return value is persisted and the step won't execute
again.  If a task fails, it retries from the last checkpoint.

Tasks can also **sleep** (suspend until a time) or **await events** (suspend
until a named event is emitted).  Events are cached — first emit wins — making
them race-free.

=== "TypeScript"

    ```typescript
    import { Absurd } from 'absurd-sdk';

    const app = new Absurd();

    app.registerTask({ name: 'order-fulfillment' }, async (params, ctx) => {
      const payment = await ctx.step('process-payment', async () => {
        return { paymentId: `pay-${params.orderId}`, amount: params.amount };
      });

      const shipment = await ctx.awaitEvent(`shipment.packed:${params.orderId}`);

      await ctx.step('send-notification', async () => {
        return { sentTo: params.email, trackingNumber: shipment.trackingNumber };
      });

      return { orderId: params.orderId, payment, trackingNumber: shipment.trackingNumber };
    });

    await app.startWorker();
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from absurd_sdk import Absurd

    app = Absurd()


    @app.register_task(name="order-fulfillment")
    def process_order(params, ctx):
        def process_payment():
            return {
                "payment_id": f"pay-{params['order_id']}",
                "amount": params["amount"],
            }

        payment = ctx.step("process-payment", process_payment)

        shipment = ctx.await_event(f"shipment.packed:{params['order_id']}")

        def send_notification():
            return {
                "sent_to": params["email"],
                "tracking_number": shipment["tracking_number"],
            }

        ctx.step("send-notification", send_notification)

        return {
            "order_id": params["order_id"],
            "payment": payment,
            "tracking_number": shipment["tracking_number"],
        }


    app.start_worker()
    ```
